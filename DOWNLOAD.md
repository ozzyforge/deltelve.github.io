# requirements
Deltelve requires Fabric API. This is the only requirement and (hopefuly) i will continue to develop

# important!
Deltelve will most likely be incompatable with most content mods, this includes (but is not limited to)
- Any mods that change world generation (Ex. Biomes o' Plenty)
- REI (some recipes cannot be looked up)
- Reactive Music (In older versions, Reactive music overlaps with the music that plays at y=-55)

If you find any other incompatabilites, please report them in the bug-reports forum in the Discord.
